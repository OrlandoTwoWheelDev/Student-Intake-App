# Student Intake App

A simple .NET 8 application to manage student intake data.

## Day 1

I received the code challenge and started working on it after some initial research.

***Turns out*** there’s a lot I *don’t* have to build from scratch with C#/.NET. I expected to spend hours setting up configs like in TypeScript, Vite, or Node — but nope! Just making sure the right packages were installed and everything was running was enough. I may have shed a joyful tear!

Now that the setup is done, I can fully focus on what matters: learning and implementing the challenge. My “setup” day is officially complete — time to hustle on the code and knowledge tomorrow! 💪🧠🤩
